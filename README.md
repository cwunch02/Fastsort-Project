# Text Sorting 

## About this project

This was my first project of junior year, coming from one of my Operating Systems classes. I enjoyed this class and this first project involved sorting text from a specific letter in each line that one could choose. It would break ties with consecutive letters being judged after the chosen letter. This was a nice warmup to my junior year, and involved dusting off some basic C skills. Feel free to try it out, granted you have a C compiler on hand!
